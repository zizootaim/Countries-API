## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) - For Sketlon Loader


### What I learned

I have learned how to style components in React JS and write JSX Snippets.

Using Css , Css Grid and Flexbox enables me to make the app Responsive to other screens.

To Navigate through the app and show another components or pages, I used React Router to access the pages without reloading the page.

I have practiced on fetching data from an API and how to manipulate it.
then how to update the UI page using React JS Components and Some Hooks like useReducer,useState and useEffect and React Context to access the state through the whole page.

To search and filter the data, I used some JS high order methods such as filter and map.




### Continued development

I wanna continue learning Web Development generally and learn more advanced topics and tools that help me to build more complicated apps such as business apps and more.
but now I'm focusing on learning Front End Development very well.


### Useful resources

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton , 
I used this resource for the sketlon loader and it helps me and provide my time.

- Thunder Client : it is an extension in vsCode to test the APIs and it helped me understand the API I worked with.
